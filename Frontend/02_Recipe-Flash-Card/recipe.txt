Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies

Yields: About 2 dozen cookies
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 10-12 minutes per batch

Ingredients:
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup chocolate chips (milk chocolate, semi-sweet, or a mix)

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. Cream butter and sugars: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter and both sugars together with an electric mixer until light and creamy (this usually takes 2-3 minutes).
   * **Tip:** Make sure your butter is truly softened, not melted, for the best texture.

3. Beat in egg and vanilla: Beat in the egg until well combined, then stir in the vanilla extract.

4. Whisk dry ingredients: In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
   * **Tip:** Whisking helps to evenly distribute the baking soda and salt.

5. Combine wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet
ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix;
overmixing can lead to tough cookies.

6. Stir in chocolate chips: Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
   * **Tip:** For extra flavor, try using a mix of chocolate chips or even chunks.

7. Drop onto baking sheets: Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the 
prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie.
   * **Tip:** Use a cookie scoop for uniform-sized cookies.

8. Bake: Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers still look slightly soft.
   * **Tip:** Don't overbake! The cookies will continue to set as they cool.

9. Cool: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before 
transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
   * **Tip:** For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them. For crispier cookies,
   bake them for an extra minute or two.
