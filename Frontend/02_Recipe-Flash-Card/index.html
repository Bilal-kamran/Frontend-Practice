        </li>
        <li>
          1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
        </li>
        <li>
          1 large egg
        </li>
        <li>
          1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        </li>
        <li>
          1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>
          1/2 teaspoon baking soda
        </li>
        <li>
          1/4 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
          1 cup chocolate chips (mild chocolate, semi-sweet, or a mix)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 375&degF (190&degC). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cream butter and sugars:</b> In a large bowl, beat the softened 
          butter and both sugars together with an electric mixer until light
          creamy (this usually takes 2-3 minutes).
          <br>
          <b>Tip:</b> Make sure your butter is truly softened, not melted, for the
          best texture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Beat in egg and vanilla:</b> Beat in egg until well combined, then
          stir in the vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Whisk dry ingredients:</b> In a seperate medium bowl, whisk together
          the flour, baking soda, and salt.
          <br>
          <b>Tip:</b> Whisking helps to evenly distribute the baking soda and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</b> Gradually add the dry ingredients
          to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be
          careful not to overmix; overmixing can lead to tough cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stir in chocolate chips:</b> Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly
          distributed throughout the dough.
          <br>
          <b>Tip:</b> For extra flavor, try using a mix of chocolate chips or even
          chunks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Drop onto baking sheets:</b> Drop rounded tablespoon of cookie dough
          onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie.
          <br>
          <b>Tip:</b> Use a cookie scoop for uniform-sized cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bake:</b> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown
          and the centers still look slightly soft.
          <br>
          <b>Tip:</b> Don't overbake! The cookies will continue to set as they cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cool:</b> Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes
          before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
          <br>
          <b>Tip:</b> For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them. For cripier
          cookies, bake them for an extra minute or two.
        </li>
